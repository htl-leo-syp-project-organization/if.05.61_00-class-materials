### What to install
- [node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- `npm install json-server` [Github page of json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server)
- If you use Visual Studio Code: REST Client

### Experiment with the json-server
- Create a directory for your experiments, start Visual Studio Code and create a file named `db.json` (as an example).

Some ideas for experimenting could be:
1. Get all posts
2. Get a specific post
3. Add a post
4. Delete a post
5. Put a post
6. Patch a post
7. Get all comments
8. Embed comments in all posts
