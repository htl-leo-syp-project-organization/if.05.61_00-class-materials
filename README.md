# System Planning and Project Development (SYPPRE)
## Introduction
This course introduces basic methods and technologies necessary for running projects in the IT business in general and software in particular. The range is rather wide and reaches from typical social skills like creativity techniques over half technical half social stuff like requirements engineering to really technical things like test driven development.

Since material of this course is held in three different study programs the different chapters are basically independent and can be used in whatever order it suits for the concrete program.
